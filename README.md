# Interactive Image Processing Tool

## Overview

This project presents a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for image processing, enabling users to easily apply various filters and techniques for digital image enhancement. Developed with Tkinter in Python, the GUI allows image upload and interactive engagement with spatial domain image enhancement techniques. The project emphasizes fundamental aspects of digital image processing, aiming to enhance specific image features while suppressing others.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload images through a simple interface.
- **Contrast Stretching**: Enhance image contrast.
- **Image Negation**: Invert image colors.
- **Density Clipping**: Control image intensity.
- **Edge Enhancement**: Apply Sobel and Laplace filters.
- **Spatial Filtering**: Use various spatial filters to improve image quality.
- **Fourier Transforms**: Analyze images in the frequency domain.
- **Noise Manipulation**: Add and remove different types of noise, including salt and pepper noise and periodic noise.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **OpenCV**: For advanced image processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For graphical outputs and visualizations.
